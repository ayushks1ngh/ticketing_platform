## Plan to Build the Next.js Party Website

### 1. Project Setup
1. Create a new Next.js 13+ project (with App Router) at "C:\Users\ayush\OneDrive\Desktop\party-website" using TypeScript:
   - Use `npx create-next-app@latest party-website --use-npm --ts` and then move to the specified folder.
   - Configure `tsconfig.json` and `eslint` for best practices.
2. Initialize Git repository and set up basic folder structure.
3. Install project dependencies:
   - `npm install firebase stripe next --save`
   - Install necessary type definitions, e.g., `npm install -D @types/node @types/react @types/firebase @types/stripe --save-dev`.

### 2. Environment Configuration
1. Create `.env` files for development, staging, and production:
   - Store Firebase API keys, Stripe keys, and any other sensitive configuration.
   - Leverage Next.js built-in environment variable support with Next.js 13 App Router.
2. Add feature flags or versioning if needed for different rollout scenarios.

### 3. Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project and configure Firestore, Authentication, and other services.
2. In the `firebase/` directory, maintain a `firebaseConfig.ts` to initialize the Firebase app.
3. In your Next.js app, create a library function for:
   - Admin authentication (e.g., sign in, sign out)
   - Firestore API calls for reading/writing theme, ticket, and admin data
   - Real-time listeners for theme updates

### 4. Theme Management
1. Create a Firestore collection (e.g., "theme_config") to store theme data (colors, fonts, etc.).
2. Implement an admin page to update theme settings in real-time.
3. Use Firebase listeners (onSnapshot) to automatically update the theme across the site without requiring a page refresh.

### 5. Ticket System
1. Set up Firestore documents for different ticket tiers (e.g., General, VIP, Early Bird) with dynamic pricing and inventory info.
2. Create a Next.js API route or server component to handle ticket data fetching:
   - Implement offline caching logic (utilize Service Worker or local storage) to store ticket info if offline.
   - Perform automatic price updates for early bird pricing based on date/time or supply thresholds.
3. Add admin UI to manage ticket inventory and pricing details.

### 6. Payment Integration (Stripe)
1. Install and configure Stripe in the Next.js backend and client.
2. Create a secure checkout flow using Stripe’s client-side and server-side APIs:
   - Generate Checkout Sessions on the server using Next.js API routes or server components.
   - Handle payment success or cancellation redirects.
3. Store payment confirmation data in Firestore for future reference (e.g., receipt URLs, payment statuses).

### 7. CRM Features
1. Build an admin dashboard to:
   - Display attendee lists (pulled from Firestore).
   - Track ticket sales, revenue, and real-time updates (using Firestore’s real-time features).
   - Provide basic analytics (via aggregated data like total sales, top-selling tickets, etc.).
2. Use Next.js Middleware (`middleware.ts`) for route protection. Restrict admin routes to authenticated admins only.

### 8. Security Considerations
1. Implement secure admin authentication and authorization workflows:
   - Use Firebase Authentication to control dashboard access.
   - Restrict data writes and reads in Firestore security rules.
2. Ensure secure payment processing by only handling ephemeral or minimal PCI data (tokenized).
3. Encrypt sensitive environment variables and apply rate limiting on API endpoints for preventing misuse.

### 9. Offline Support
1. Configure a basic Service Worker to cache static assets and critical pages or APIs.
2. Store ticket information in local storage to allow viewing tickets offline.
3. Sync offline updates with Firestore when the user goes back online.

### 10. Configuration Management
1. Maintain separate `.env` files for dev, staging, and production with different Firebase and Stripe credentials.
2. Set up feature flags as boolean environment variables to toggle features on/off.
3. Provide a simple UI within the admin dashboard to toggle theme features or partial site features.

### 11. Documentation and Final Touches
1. Document component usage, app structure, environment setup, and deployment steps.
2. Include loading states and error handling in each major user flow (theme changes, ticket purchase, etc.).
3. Deploy to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel or Firebase Hosting) for final testing and release.
